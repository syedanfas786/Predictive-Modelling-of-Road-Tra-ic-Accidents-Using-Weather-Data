# Predictive-Modelling-of-Road-Tra-ic-Accidents-Using-Weather-Data
Developed a predictive model to analyze the influence of weather conditions—including temperature, precipitation, and the Excess Heat Factor (EHF)—on road traffic accidents. By leveraging linear models and Generalized Additive Models (GAM), the model enhances predictive accuracy, providing valuable insights that assist emergency services in resource allocation and traffic management by forecasting accident risks based on historical weather data.
