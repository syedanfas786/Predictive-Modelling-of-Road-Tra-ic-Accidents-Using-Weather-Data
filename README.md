# Predictive Modelling of Road Traffic Accidents Using Weather Data

## Overview

This project develops a predictive model to analyze the influence of weather conditions—including temperature, precipitation, and the Excess Heat Factor (EHF)—on road traffic accidents. By leveraging linear models and Generalized Additive Models (GAM), this model enhances predictive accuracy and provides valuable insights that assist emergency services in resource allocation and traffic management.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze the impact of various weather conditions on road traffic accidents.
- Utilize linear models and GAM to improve predictive accuracy.
- Provide insights that can help emergency services effectively allocate resources.
- Forecast accident risks based on historical weather data.

## Technologies Used

- **R**: Programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
- **dplyr/tidyr**: Libraries for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **ggplot2**: Library for data visualization.
- **mgcv**: Library for fitting Generalized Additive Models.

## Getting Started

To replicate or extend the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Predictive-Modelling-of-Road-Traffic-Accidents-Using-Weather-Data.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Predictive-Modelling-of-Road-Traffic-Accidents-Using-Weather-Data
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Ensure you have R installed along with the necessary packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "mgcv"))
   ```

4. **Run the Analysis**:
   Execute the main analysis script:
   ```R
   source("analysis_script.R")
   ```

## Results

The analysis yields:

- Predictive models showcasing the relationship between weather conditions and road traffic accidents.
- Visualizations highlighting patterns and trends in accident occurrences based on weather data.
- Insights for emergency services to optimize resource allocation and traffic management.
